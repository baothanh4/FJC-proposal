	"content": "AWS services scale to new heights for Prime Day 2025: key metrics and milestones Amazon Prime Day 2025 was the biggest Amazon Prime Day shopping event ever, setting records for both sales volume and total items sold during the 4-day event. Prime members saved billions while shopping Amazon’s millions of deals during the event.\nThis year marked a significant transformation in the Prime Day experience through advancements in the generative AI offerings from Amazon and AWS. Customers used Alexa+—the Amazon next-generation personal assistant now available in early access to millions of customers—along with the AI-powered shopping assistant, Rufus, and AI Shopping Guides. These features, built on more than 15 years of cloud innovation and machine learning expertise from AWS, combined with deep retail and consumer experience from Amazon, helped customers quickly discover deals and get product information, complementing the fast, free delivery that Prime members enjoy year-round.\nAs part of our annual tradition to tell you about how AWS powered Prime Day for record-breaking sales, I want to share the services and chart-topping metrics from AWS that made your amazing shopping experience possible.\nPrime Day 2025 – all the numbers During the weeks leading up to big shopping events like Prime Day, Amazon fulfillment centers and delivery stations work to get ready and ensure operations run efficiently and safely. For example, the Amazon automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS) operates a global fleet of industrial mobile robots that move goods around Amazon fulfillment centers.\nAWS Outposts, a fully managed service that extends the AWS experience on-premises, powers software applications that manage the command-and-control of Amazon ASRS and supports same-day and next-day deliveries through low-latency processing of critical robotic commands.\nDuring Prime Day 2025, AWS Outposts at one of the largest Amazon fulfillment centers sent more than 524 million commands to over 7,000 robots, reaching peak volumes of 8 million commands per hour—a 160 percent increase compared to Prime Day 2024.\nHere are some more interesting, mind-blowing metrics:\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) – During Prime Day 2025, AWS Graviton, a family of processors designed to deliver the best price performance for cloud workloads running in Amazon EC2, powered more than 40 percent of the Amazon EC2 compute used by Amazon.com. Amazon also deployed over 87,000 AWS Inferentia and AWS Trainium chips – custom silicon chips for deep learning and generative AI training and inference – to power Amazon Rufus for Prime Day.\nAmazon SageMaker AI — Amazon SageMaker AI, a fully managed service that brings together a broad set of tools to enable high-performance, low-cost machine learning (ML), processed more than 626 billion inference requests during Prime Day 2025.\nAmazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and AWS Fargate– Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that works seamlessly with AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers. During Prime Day 2025, Amazon ECS launched an average of 18.4 million tasks per day on AWS Fargate, representing a 77 percent increase from the previous year’s Prime Day average.\nAWS Fault Injection Service (AWS FIS) – We ran over 6,800 AWS FIS experiments—over eight times more than we conducted in 2024—to test resilience and ensure Amazon.com remains highly available on Prime Day. This significant increase was made possible by two improvements: new Amazon ECS support for network fault injection experiments on AWS Fargate, and the integration of FIS testing in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.\nAWS Lambda – AWS Lambda, a serverless compute service that lets you run code without managing infrastructure, handled over 1.7 trillion invocations per day during Prime Day 2025.\nAmazon API Gateway – During Prime Day 2025, Amazon API Gateway, a fully managed service that makes it easy to create, maintain, and secure APIs at any scale, processed over 1 trillion internal service requests—a 30 percent increase in requests on average per day compared to Prime Day 2024.\nAmazon CloudFront – Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers content with low latency and high transfer speeds, delivered over 3 trillion HTTP requests during the global week of Prime Day 2025, a 43 percent increase in requests compared to Prime Day 2024.\nAmazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) – During Prime Day 2025, Amazon EBS, our high-performance block storage service, peaked at 20.3 trillion I/O operations, moving up to an exabyte of data daily.\nAmazon Aurora – On Prime Day, Amazon Aurora, a relational database management system (RDBMS) built for high performance and availability at global scale for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and DSQL, processed 500 billion transactions, stored 4,071 terabytes of data, and transferred 999 terabytes of data.\nAmazon DynamoDB – Amazon DynamoDB, a serverless, fully managed, distributed NoSQL database, powers multiple high-traffic Amazon properties and systems including Alexa, the Amazon.com sites, and all Amazon fulfillment centers. Over the course of Prime Day, these sources made tens of trillions of calls to the DynamoDB API. DynamoDB maintained high availability while delivering single-digit millisecond responses and peaking at 151 million requests per second.\nAmazon ElastiCache – During Prime Day, Amazon ElastiCache, a fully managed caching service delivering microsecond latency, peaked at serving over 1.5 quadrillion daily requests and over 1.4 trillion requests in a minute.\nAmazon Kinesis Data Streams – Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, a fully managed serverless data streaming service, processed a peak of 807 million records per second during Prime Day 2025.\nAmazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) – During Prime Day 2025, Amazon SQS – a fully managed message queuing service for microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications – set a new peak traffic record of 166 million messages per second.\nAmazon GuardDuty – During Prime Day 2025, Amazon GuardDuty, an intelligent threat detection service, monitored an average of 8.9 trillion log events per hour, a 48.9 percent increase from last year’s Prime Day.\nAWS CloudTrail – AWS CloudTrail, which tracks user activity and API usage on AWS, as well as in hybrid and multicloud environments, processed over 2.5 trillion events during Prime Day 2025, compared to 976 billion events in 2024.\nPrepared to scale\nIf you’re preparing for similar business-critical events, product launches, and migrations, I recommend that you take advantage of our newly branded AWS Countdown (formerly known as AWS Infrastructure Event Management, or IEM). This comprehensive support program helps assess operational readiness, identify and mitigate risks, and plan capacity, using proven playbooks developed by AWS experts. We’ve expanded to include: generative AI implementation support to help you confidently launch and scale AI initiatives; migration and modernization support, including mainframe modernization; and infrastructure optimization for specialized sectors including election systems, retail operations, healthcare services, and sports and gaming events.\nI look forward to seeing what other records will be broken next year!\n— Channy\n"

	"content": "\rAWS named as a Leader in 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms and Container Management A month ago, I shared that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is recognized as a Leader in 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services (SCPS), with Gartner naming AWS a Leader for the fifteenth consecutive year.\nIn 2024, AWS was named as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants, Cloud-Native Application Platforms, Cloud Database Management Systems, Container Management, Data Integration Tools, Desktop as a Service (DaaS), and Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms as well as the SCPS. In 2025, we were also recognized as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS), Desktop as a Service and Data Science and Machine Learning (DSML) platforms. We strongly believe this means AWS provides the broadest and deepest range of services to customers.\nToday, I’m happy to share recent Magic Quadrant reports that named AWS as a Leader in more cloud technology markets: Cloud-Native Application Platforms (aka Cloud Application Platforms) and Container Management.\n2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms AWS has been named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms for 2 consecutive years. AWS was positioned highest on “Ability to Execute”. Gartner defines cloud-native application platforms as those that provide managed application runtime environments for applications and integrated capabilities to manage the lifecycle of an application or application component in the cloud environment. The following image is the graphical representation of the 2025 Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms.\nOur comprehensive cloud-native application portfolio—AWS Lambda, AWS App Runner, AWS Amplify, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk—offers flexible options for building modern applications with strong AI capabilities, demonstrated through continued innovation and deep integration across our broader AWS service portfolio.\nYou can simplify the service selection through comprehensive documentation, reference architectures, and prescriptive guidance available in the AWS Solutions Library, along with AI-powered, contextual recommendations from Amazon Q based on your specific requirements. While AWS Lambda is optimized for AWS to provide the best possible serverless experience, it follows industry standards for serverless computing and supports common programming languages and frameworks. You can find all necessary capabilities within AWS, including advanced features for AI/ML, edge computing, and enterprise integration.\nYou can build, deploy, and scale generative AI agents and applications by integrating these compute offerings with Amazon Bedrock for serverless inferences and Amazon SageMaker for artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) training and management.\nAccess the complete 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms to learn more.\n2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Container Management In the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Container Management, AWS has been named as a Leader for three years and was positioned furthest for “Completeness of Vision”. Gartner defines container management as offerings that support the deployment and operation of containerized workloads. This process involves orchestrating and overseeing the entire lifecycle of containers, covering deployment, scaling, and operations, to ensure their efficient and consistent performance across different environments.\nThe following image is the graphical representation of the 2025 Magic Quadrant for Container Management.\nAWS container services offer fully managed container orchestration with AWS native solutions and open-source technologies to focus on providing a wide range of deployment options, from Kubernetes to our native orchestrator.\nYou can use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Both can be used with AWS Fargate for serverless container deployment. Additionally, EKS Auto Mode simplifies Kubernetes management by automatically provisioning infrastructure, selecting optimal compute instances, and dynamically scaling resources for containerized applications.\nYou can connect on-premises and edge infrastructure back to AWS container services with EKS Hybrid Nodes and ECS Anywhere, or use EKS Anywhere for a fully disconnected Kubernetes experience supported by AWS. With flexible compute and deployment options, you can reduce operational overhead and focus on innovation and drive business value faster.\nAccess the complete 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Container Management to learn more.\n— Channy\n"

Is the input you give to an AI model (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or models on Amazon Bedrock) to get a specific output. Example What is difference between Zero-Shot, Few-Shot and Chain of Thought in Prompting Techniques? Technique Description When to Use Advantages Limitations Example Prompt Style Zero-Shot Model gets only the instruction with no examples. Simple tasks; model already understands domain. Short prompts, fast, minimal setup. Lower accuracy for complex or domain-specific tasks. \u0026ldquo;Classify the text into neutral, negative or positive\u0026rdquo; Few-Shot Provide a few examples to teach the pattern. Custom formats; domain tasks; pattern learning. Higher accuracy; model learns your desired style. Longer prompt; can become costly at scale. \u0026ldquo;A whatpu is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania. An example of a sentence that uses the word whatpu is: We were traveling in Africa and we saw these very cute whatpus. \u0026quot; Chain-of-Thought Ask model to explain reasoning step-by-step.

Their case studies demonstrated how organizations apply foundation models, RAG, and agent-based architectures in enterprise systems. The discussions helped clarify not just how these technologies work, but why they matter for scalability and business innovation. Hands-on technical exposure Practical sessions on Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting improved my understanding of effective prompt engineering. The walkthrough of RAG workflows showed how grounding AI responses in real data reduces hallucinations and improves accuracy. Live demos of Bedrock AgentCore helped me visualize how AI agents plan tasks, execute tools, and integrate securely with AWS services. Understanding modernization and architecture The workshop highlighted the shift from traditional ML to foundation-model-driven AI and explained the differences in training, customization, and usage. I learned how organizations modernize systems using: Event-driven architecture Domain-driven design (DDD) AI-augmented workflows These approaches helped me understand how to design applications that are scalable, resilient, and intelligent. Exposure to modern AI tools Demonstrations of Amazon Titan Embeddings, Textract, Comprehend, Kendra, Polly, and other AI services showed how to quickly integrate intelligence into applications. Learning about Amazon Q Developer highlighted how AI can support the entire software lifecycle—from planning to coding and refactoring. Networking and knowledge exchange Discussions with cloud engineers, AI specialists, and developers broadened my understanding of industry use cases and challenges. These conversations reinforced the importance of aligning business objectives, data modeling, and technology decisions. Key takeaways RAG enables enterprise-grade AI by grounding answers in verified data. Prompt engineering matters—well-structured prompts lead to more reliable results.

They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability. "

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud. In the next step, we will create a S3 bucket and a file in it.\nCreate a file and upload to s3 bucket Change to the ssm-user\u0026rsquo;s home directory by typing cd ~ in the CLI Create a new file to use for testing with the command fallocate -l 1G testfile.xyz, which will create a file of 1GB size named \u0026ldquo;testfile.xyz\u0026rdquo;. Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"

Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own VPCs (referred to as PrivateLink Endpoint Services), and supported AWS Marketplace Partner services.

	"content": "AWS PrivateLink endpoints have a fixed IP address in each Availability Zone where they are deployed, for the life of the endpoint (until it is deleted). These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section). The CloudFormation template you deployed in the Prepare the environment section created this Private Hosted Zone. Click on the name of the Private Hosted Zone, s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com: Create a new record in the Private Hosted Zone: Record name and record type keep default options Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N.

Record type: keep default value (type A) Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor The new records appear in the Route 53 console:\nCreate a Resolver Forwarding Rule Route 53 Resolver Forwarding Rules allow you to forward DNS queries from your VPC to other sources for name resolution. Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint. Using DNS to resolve the endpoint IP addresses provides high availability in-case of an Availability Zone outage.\n"

AWS CLI actions targeted to your original S3 bucket failed because you applied a policy that only allowed access to the second bucket you created. AWS CLI actions targeted for your second bucket succeeded because the policy allowed them. These policies can be useful in situations where you need to control access to resources through VPC endpoints.\n"

Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nSecure Hybrid Access to S3 using VPC Endpoints Overview AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity to AWS services from VPCs and your on-premises networks, without exposing your traffic to the Public Internet.\nIn this lab, you will learn how to create, configure, and test VPC endpoints that enable your workloads to reach AWS services without traversing the Public Internet.\nYou will create two types of endpoints to access Amazon S3: a Gateway VPC endpoint, and an Interface VPC endpoint. These two types of VPC endpoints offer different benefits depending on if you are accessing Amazon S3 from the cloud or your on-premises location\nGateway - Create a gateway endpoint to send traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB using private IP addresses.You route traffic from your VPC to the gateway endpoint using route tables. Interface - Create an interface endpoint to send traffic to endpoint services that use a Network Load Balancer to distribute traffic. Traffic destined for the endpoint service is resolved using DNS.

Also i have to optimize the cost, performance and increased security layers\nWhen i am in the company, i always to check my to do list and check all the task that i haven\u0026rsquo;t done yesterday. Besides that i have chance to meet my mentor and ask them help when i have an issue or something. In the progress of study, me with my teammates have to build the websites and using AWS services.\nTo objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:\nNo. Criteria Description Good Fair Average 1 Professional knowledge \u0026amp; skills Understanding of the field, applying knowledge in practice, proficiency with tools, work quality ☐ ✅ ☐ 2 Ability to learn Ability to absorb new knowledge and learn quickly ☐ ✅ ☐ 3 Proactiveness Taking initiative, seeking out tasks without waiting for instructions ✅ ☐ ☐ 4 Sense of responsibility Completing tasks on time and ensuring quality ☐ ✅ ☐ 5 Discipline Adhering to schedules, rules, and work processes ✅ ☐ ☐ 6 Progressive mindset Willingness to receive feedback and improve oneself ☐ ☐ ✅ 7 Communication Presenting ideas and reporting work clearly ☐ ✅ ☐ 8 Teamwork Working effectively with colleagues and participating in teams ☐ ✅ ☐ 9 Professional conduct Respecting colleagues, partners, and the work environment ✅ ☐ ☐ 10 Problem-solving skills Identifying problems, proposing solutions, and showing creativity ☐ ✅ ☐ 11 Contribution to project/team Work effectiveness, innovative ideas, recognition from the team ✅ ☐ ☐ 12 Overall General evaluation of the entire internship period ☐ ✅ ☐ Needs Improvement I am internal person so i barely communicated with my mentor, i need to change my how to communicate with my mentor and spend time to meet them to ask them about my problem. I need improve my project management skill because i have to train my teammates and give them a task but i don\u0026rsquo;t have a method like Agile or Scrum to develop a software like coworker. I always to think about how the services work and how they apply to my application but sometime i don\u0026rsquo;t understand them, so i need to spend time to improve my logic mindset to understand them.

	"content": " Here you can freely provide personal feedback about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program, helping the FCJ team improve areas that need attention based on the following categories:\nGeneral Evaluation 1. Work Environment\nThe work environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to support me whenever I face difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think additional team bonding or networking sessions could help everyone understand each other more.\n2. Support from Mentors / Team Admins\nMentors provide detailed guidance, explain clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourage me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, documents, and creates conditions for smooth work. I appreciate that mentors allow me to try and solve problems on my own instead of just giving answers.\n3. Job Fit with Academic Background\nThe tasks assigned match my knowledge from school while also expanding into new areas I had not encountered before. This allowed me to reinforce my foundational knowledge while learning practical skills.\n4. Learning Opportunities \u0026amp; Skill Development\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork, and professional communication in a corporate environment. Mentors also shared practical experiences, helping me better plan my career path.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: people respect each other, work seriously but remain cheerful. When urgent projects arise, everyone helps each other regardless of position. This made me feel part of the team even as an intern.\n6. Intern Benefits / Policies\nThe company provides internship allowances and offers flexible working hours when needed. Additionally, participating in internal training sessions is a great advantage.\nOther Questions What are you most satisfied with during the internship?\nDuring the learning process, I felt comfortable adapting to the company’s work culture and was very satisfied with the guidance from mentors. What do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?\nThe company could improve opportunities for students to come to the office daily. If recommending to friends, would you advise them to intern here? Why?\nIf I were to introduce this to friends, I would recommend it because Amazon Web Services Vietnam is not only a cloud computing company but also has a large AWS study group community in Vietnam, allowing students to learn about cloud computing. Suggestions \u0026amp; Wishes Any advice to enhance the internship experience?\nI would like to join the company club to learn more from mentors and see how they lead a team. Would you like to continue this program in the future?\nI would like to be more closely associated with the company. Other feedback (free sharing)\nNo additional feedback at this time. "
