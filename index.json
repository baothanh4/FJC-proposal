	"content": "AWS services scale to new heights for Prime Day 2025: key metrics and milestones Amazon Prime Day 2025 was the biggest Amazon Prime Day shopping event ever, setting records for both sales volume and total items sold during the 4-day event. Prime members saved billions while shopping Amazon’s millions of deals during the event.\nThis year marked a significant transformation in the Prime Day experience through advancements in the generative AI offerings from Amazon and AWS. Customers used Alexa+—the Amazon next-generation personal assistant now available in early access to millions of customers—along with the AI-powered shopping assistant, Rufus, and AI Shopping Guides. These features, built on more than 15 years of cloud innovation and machine learning expertise from AWS, combined with deep retail and consumer experience from Amazon, helped customers quickly discover deals and get product information, complementing the fast, free delivery that Prime members enjoy year-round.\nAs part of our annual tradition to tell you about how AWS powered Prime Day for record-breaking sales, I want to share the services and chart-topping metrics from AWS that made your amazing shopping experience possible.\nPrime Day 2025 – all the numbers During the weeks leading up to big shopping events like Prime Day, Amazon fulfillment centers and delivery stations work to get ready and ensure operations run efficiently and safely. For example, the Amazon automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS) operates a global fleet of industrial mobile robots that move goods around Amazon fulfillment centers.\nAWS Outposts, a fully managed service that extends the AWS experience on-premises, powers software applications that manage the command-and-control of Amazon ASRS and supports same-day and next-day deliveries through low-latency processing of critical robotic commands.\nDuring Prime Day 2025, AWS Outposts at one of the largest Amazon fulfillment centers sent more than 524 million commands to over 7,000 robots, reaching peak volumes of 8 million commands per hour—a 160 percent increase compared to Prime Day 2024.\nHere are some more interesting, mind-blowing metrics:\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) – During Prime Day 2025, AWS Graviton, a family of processors designed to deliver the best price performance for cloud workloads running in Amazon EC2, powered more than 40 percent of the Amazon EC2 compute used by Amazon.com. Amazon also deployed over 87,000 AWS Inferentia and AWS Trainium chips – custom silicon chips for deep learning and generative AI training and inference – to power Amazon Rufus for Prime Day.\nAmazon SageMaker AI — Amazon SageMaker AI, a fully managed service that brings together a broad set of tools to enable high-performance, low-cost machine learning (ML), processed more than 626 billion inference requests during Prime Day 2025.\nAmazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and AWS Fargate– Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that works seamlessly with AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers. During Prime Day 2025, Amazon ECS launched an average of 18.4 million tasks per day on AWS Fargate, representing a 77 percent increase from the previous year’s Prime Day average.\nAWS Fault Injection Service (AWS FIS) – We ran over 6,800 AWS FIS experiments—over eight times more than we conducted in 2024—to test resilience and ensure Amazon.com remains highly available on Prime Day. This significant increase was made possible by two improvements: new Amazon ECS support for network fault injection experiments on AWS Fargate, and the integration of FIS testing in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.\nAWS Lambda – AWS Lambda, a serverless compute service that lets you run code without managing infrastructure, handled over 1.7 trillion invocations per day during Prime Day 2025.\nAmazon API Gateway – During Prime Day 2025, Amazon API Gateway, a fully managed service that makes it easy to create, maintain, and secure APIs at any scale, processed over 1 trillion internal service requests—a 30 percent increase in requests on average per day compared to Prime Day 2024.\nAmazon CloudFront – Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers content with low latency and high transfer speeds, delivered over 3 trillion HTTP requests during the global week of Prime Day 2025, a 43 percent increase in requests compared to Prime Day 2024.\nAmazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) – During Prime Day 2025, Amazon EBS, our high-performance block storage service, peaked at 20.3 trillion I/O operations, moving up to an exabyte of data daily.\nAmazon Aurora – On Prime Day, Amazon Aurora, a relational database management system (RDBMS) built for high performance and availability at global scale for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and DSQL, processed 500 billion transactions, stored 4,071 terabytes of data, and transferred 999 terabytes of data.\nAmazon DynamoDB – Amazon DynamoDB, a serverless, fully managed, distributed NoSQL database, powers multiple high-traffic Amazon properties and systems including Alexa, the Amazon.com sites, and all Amazon fulfillment centers. Over the course of Prime Day, these sources made tens of trillions of calls to the DynamoDB API. DynamoDB maintained high availability while delivering single-digit millisecond responses and peaking at 151 million requests per second.\nAmazon ElastiCache – During Prime Day, Amazon ElastiCache, a fully managed caching service delivering microsecond latency, peaked at serving over 1.5 quadrillion daily requests and over 1.4 trillion requests in a minute.\nAmazon Kinesis Data Streams – Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, a fully managed serverless data streaming service, processed a peak of 807 million records per second during Prime Day 2025.\nAmazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) – During Prime Day 2025, Amazon SQS – a fully managed message queuing service for microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications – set a new peak traffic record of 166 million messages per second.\nAmazon GuardDuty – During Prime Day 2025, Amazon GuardDuty, an intelligent threat detection service, monitored an average of 8.9 trillion log events per hour, a 48.9 percent increase from last year’s Prime Day.\nAWS CloudTrail – AWS CloudTrail, which tracks user activity and API usage on AWS, as well as in hybrid and multicloud environments, processed over 2.5 trillion events during Prime Day 2025, compared to 976 billion events in 2024.\nPrepared to scale\nIf you’re preparing for similar business-critical events, product launches, and migrations, I recommend that you take advantage of our newly branded AWS Countdown (formerly known as AWS Infrastructure Event Management, or IEM). This comprehensive support program helps assess operational readiness, identify and mitigate risks, and plan capacity, using proven playbooks developed by AWS experts. We’ve expanded to include: generative AI implementation support to help you confidently launch and scale AI initiatives; migration and modernization support, including mainframe modernization; and infrastructure optimization for specialized sectors including election systems, retail operations, healthcare services, and sports and gaming events.\nI look forward to seeing what other records will be broken next year!\n— Channy\n"

	"content": "\rAWS named as a Leader in 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms and Container Management A month ago, I shared that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is recognized as a Leader in 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services (SCPS), with Gartner naming AWS a Leader for the fifteenth consecutive year.\nIn 2024, AWS was named as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants, Cloud-Native Application Platforms, Cloud Database Management Systems, Container Management, Data Integration Tools, Desktop as a Service (DaaS), and Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms as well as the SCPS. In 2025, we were also recognized as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS), Desktop as a Service and Data Science and Machine Learning (DSML) platforms. We strongly believe this means AWS provides the broadest and deepest range of services to customers.\nToday, I’m happy to share recent Magic Quadrant reports that named AWS as a Leader in more cloud technology markets: Cloud-Native Application Platforms (aka Cloud Application Platforms) and Container Management.\n2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms AWS has been named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms for 2 consecutive years. AWS was positioned highest on “Ability to Execute”. Gartner defines cloud-native application platforms as those that provide managed application runtime environments for applications and integrated capabilities to manage the lifecycle of an application or application component in the cloud environment. The following image is the graphical representation of the 2025 Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms.\nOur comprehensive cloud-native application portfolio—AWS Lambda, AWS App Runner, AWS Amplify, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk—offers flexible options for building modern applications with strong AI capabilities, demonstrated through continued innovation and deep integration across our broader AWS service portfolio.\nYou can simplify the service selection through comprehensive documentation, reference architectures, and prescriptive guidance available in the AWS Solutions Library, along with AI-powered, contextual recommendations from Amazon Q based on your specific requirements. While AWS Lambda is optimized for AWS to provide the best possible serverless experience, it follows industry standards for serverless computing and supports common programming languages and frameworks. You can find all necessary capabilities within AWS, including advanced features for AI/ML, edge computing, and enterprise integration.\nYou can build, deploy, and scale generative AI agents and applications by integrating these compute offerings with Amazon Bedrock for serverless inferences and Amazon SageMaker for artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) training and management.\nAccess the complete 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms to learn more.\n2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Container Management In the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Container Management, AWS has been named as a Leader for three years and was positioned furthest for “Completeness of Vision”. Gartner defines container management as offerings that support the deployment and operation of containerized workloads. This process involves orchestrating and overseeing the entire lifecycle of containers, covering deployment, scaling, and operations, to ensure their efficient and consistent performance across different environments.\nThe following image is the graphical representation of the 2025 Magic Quadrant for Container Management.\nAWS container services offer fully managed container orchestration with AWS native solutions and open-source technologies to focus on providing a wide range of deployment options, from Kubernetes to our native orchestrator.\nYou can use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Both can be used with AWS Fargate for serverless container deployment. Additionally, EKS Auto Mode simplifies Kubernetes management by automatically provisioning infrastructure, selecting optimal compute instances, and dynamically scaling resources for containerized applications.\nYou can connect on-premises and edge infrastructure back to AWS container services with EKS Hybrid Nodes and ECS Anywhere, or use EKS Anywhere for a fully disconnected Kubernetes experience supported by AWS. With flexible compute and deployment options, you can reduce operational overhead and focus on innovation and drive business value faster.\nAccess the complete 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Container Management to learn more.\n— Channy\n"

Is the input you give to an AI model (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or models on Amazon Bedrock) to get a specific output. Example What is difference between Zero-Shot, Few-Shot and Chain of Thought in Prompting Techniques? Technique Description When to Use Advantages Limitations Example Prompt Style Zero-Shot Model gets only the instruction with no examples. Simple tasks; model already understands domain. Short prompts, fast, minimal setup. Lower accuracy for complex or domain-specific tasks. \u0026ldquo;Classify the text into neutral, negative or positive\u0026rdquo; Few-Shot Provide a few examples to teach the pattern. Custom formats; domain tasks; pattern learning. Higher accuracy; model learns your desired style. Longer prompt; can become costly at scale. \u0026ldquo;A whatpu is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania. An example of a sentence that uses the word whatpu is: We were traveling in Africa and we saw these very cute whatpus. \u0026quot; Chain-of-Thought Ask model to explain reasoning step-by-step. Math, logic, coding, planning, reasoning tasks. Better reasoning, more accurate complex outputs. Slower; may generate unnecessarily long answers. \u0026ldquo;Show your step-by-step reasoning.\u0026rdquo; Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)- Retrieving relevant information from a data source What is Retrieval Augmented Generation? Retrieval: Fetches the relevant content from the external knowledge base or data sources based on a user query Augmentation: Adding the retrieved relevant context to the user prompt, which goes as an input to the foundation model Generation: Response from the foundation model based on the augmented prompt RAG Use cases Improved content quality: E.g Helps in reducing hallucinations and connecting with recent knowledge including enterprise data Contextual chatbots and question answering: E.g Enhance chatbot capabilities by integrating with real-time data Personalized search: E.g Searching based on user previous search history and persona Real-time data summarization: E.g Retrieving and summarizing transactional data from databases, or API calls\nWhat are embeddings? Numerical representation of text(vectors) that captures semantics and relationships between words\nEmbedding models capture features and nuances of the text\nRich embeddings can be used to compare text similarity\nMultilingual Text Embeddings can identity meaning in different languages\nAmazon Titan Embedding:\nTitan Text Embeddings: Translates text inputs(words,phrases) into numerical representations(Embeddings). Comparing embeddings produces more relevant and contextual responses that word matching Highlights:\nAmazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 is a light weight, efficient model ideal for high accuracy retrieval tasks at different dimensions. The model supports flexible embeddings sizes and prioritizes accuracy maintenance at smaller dimension sizes.

Their case studies demonstrated how organizations apply foundation models, RAG, and agent-based architectures in enterprise systems. The discussions helped clarify not just how these technologies work, but why they matter for scalability and business innovation. Hands-on technical exposure Practical sessions on Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting improved my understanding of effective prompt engineering. The walkthrough of RAG workflows showed how grounding AI responses in real data reduces hallucinations and improves accuracy. Live demos of Bedrock AgentCore helped me visualize how AI agents plan tasks, execute tools, and integrate securely with AWS services. Understanding modernization and architecture The workshop highlighted the shift from traditional ML to foundation-model-driven AI and explained the differences in training, customization, and usage. I learned how organizations modernize systems using: Event-driven architecture Domain-driven design (DDD) AI-augmented workflows These approaches helped me understand how to design applications that are scalable, resilient, and intelligent. Exposure to modern AI tools Demonstrations of Amazon Titan Embeddings, Textract, Comprehend, Kendra, Polly, and other AI services showed how to quickly integrate intelligence into applications. Learning about Amazon Q Developer highlighted how AI can support the entire software lifecycle—from planning to coding and refactoring. Networking and knowledge exchange Discussions with cloud engineers, AI specialists, and developers broadened my understanding of industry use cases and challenges. These conversations reinforced the importance of aligning business objectives, data modeling, and technology decisions. Key takeaways RAG enables enterprise-grade AI by grounding answers in verified data. Prompt engineering matters—well-structured prompts lead to more reliable results.

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION 1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Client background:\nRapid urbanization is increasing pressure on public transportation systems. Metropolitano Railway Systems is modernizing operations to improve reliability, passenger experience, and operational efficiency. Current on-premises systems face challenges in scalability, high availability, and real-time data processing.\nBusiness \u0026amp; Technical Objectives:\nEnsure high availability and 24/7 operations for mission-critical rail services. Enable elastic scalability to handle peak passenger loads and seasonal demand. Improve system reliability and disaster recovery capabilities. Support real-time data processing for ticketing and payment transaction monitoring, including payment status tracking and reconciliation. Strengthen security \u0026amp; compliance aligned with public-sector transportation standards. Reduce operational costs through cloud-native automation. Accelerate innovation cycles for digital services such as mobile ticketing and predictive maintenance. Use cases (POC scope):\nDigital ticketing \u0026amp; fare collection (web/app booking, QR/IC card integration). Train scheduling \u0026amp; dispatch management (contextual use case; not the primary focus of this POC). Real-time payment/transaction event analytics through Amazon Kinesis (e.g., payment status updates, settlement events, anomaly detection). BI dashboards for management decision-making using Amazon QuickSight. Incident response and alerting through centralized monitoring and logging. Summary of Professional Services (Project Team):\nDesign an AWS architecture that is secure, scalable, and fault-tolerant based on Amazon EC2 and managed services. Migrate selected workloads from on-premises infrastructure to AWS (POC scope). Implement real-time payment/ticketing event pipelines using Amazon Kinesis, with storage and analytics datasets delivered to Amazon S3. Deploy analytics using QuickSight. Set up CI/CD using CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy. Provide knowledge transfer/training to ensure operational readiness for the Client’s technical team. 1.2 PROJECT SUCCESS CRITERIA Service Reliability \u0026amp; Availability\nThe deployed system must achieve ≥ 99.9% uptime across all mission-critical services in scope (ticketing, payment monitoring, analytics). Scalability \u0026amp; Performance\nThe platform must automatically scale to handle peak passenger traffic without performance degradation. End-to-end response time for booking and payment APIs must remain under 300 ms during peak load tests (target). Real-Time Data Processing\nReal-time payment and ticketing transaction events must be processed with a latency under 5 seconds using Amazon Kinesis. Data ingestion pipelines must support at least 10,000 events/second with auto-scaling (target). Analytics \u0026amp; Insights Delivery\nManagement dashboards (QuickSight) must provide accurate, refreshed datasets within ≤ 5 minutes of data arrival in S3. CI/CD \u0026amp; Operational Excellence\nAll application deployments must be executed via automated CI/CD pipelines with rollback capability. Cost Efficiency\nAWS cost optimization mechanisms (Auto Scaling, RI/Savings Plans, lifecycle policies) target a reduction of at least 20% compared to on-premises operations. Cost Explorer and Billing Alarms must be configured to prevent overruns. 1.3 ASSUMPTIONS Prerequisites \u0026amp; Dependencies\nThe Client provides timely access to required environments, systems, and personnel. The Client supplies necessary credentials, API documentation, and integration endpoints for on-premises/third-party systems. Existing operational data (ticketing, scheduling, payment transactions) is available and accessible for migration and integration. Third-party vendors (payment gateways, fare systems, transit card systems) offer stable APIs and complete documentation. Required AWS accounts/organizations/billing structures are set up prior to project start. The Client identifies Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for each domain (operations, IT, ticketing, scheduling). Technical Constraints\nSome legacy systems may remain on-premises, requiring hybrid connectivity via VPN or Direct Connect. Existing applications may have non-cloud-optimized architectures, limiting modernization within the POC scope. Legacy data quality issues may affect migration accuracy and analytics output. Operational networks and payment/ticketing systems must support secure and reliable cloud connectivity. Real-time analytics performance depends on ingestion latency and stability from payment gateways and ticketing transaction sources. Business Constraints\nProject timelines may depend on internal Client approvals/procurement processes. The Client’s organizational readiness and staff availability may impact progress. Budget limitations may restrict scope. Certain regulatory/compliance requirements may limit data residency/retention options. Risks (high-level)\nIntegration risk (legacy undocumented behaviors). Data migration risk (inconsistent/incomplete legacy data). Operational risk (hybrid/on-prem hardware failures). Security risk (misconfigured third-party endpoints). Timeline \u0026amp; dependency risk (vendor approvals, API throughput). 2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE / ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM 2.1 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM Figure 1. AWS Technical Architecture Diagram – Metropolitano Railways (POC)\nFigure 1 (POC Outcome \u0026amp; Architecture Summary):\nThe POC enables near real-time monitoring and reconciliation of ticketing/payment transactions. Payment status events are streamed into Amazon Kinesis and delivered to Amazon S3 (data lake) for analytics. Amazon QuickSight dashboards provide revenue insights (daily/monthly) and highlight unpaid/incomplete payments for follow-up. User traffic is routed via Route 53 → CloudFront → AWS WAF to the application on Amazon EC2, with transactional data stored in Amazon RDS (private subnet). Amazon CloudWatch supports monitoring and alerting. Asynchronous workflows are decoupled using SNS/SQS (and EventBridge where needed). Source control uses GitLab; CI/CD is implemented using CodePipeline/CodeBuild/CodeDeploy.\nProduction note (recommendations for production readiness):\nEnable Multi-AZ and place workloads in private subnets behind an ALB. Restrict egress using NAT Gateway and/or VPC Endpoints. Enforce TLS (ACM), least-privilege IAM, and store secrets in Secrets Manager/SSM. Enable CloudTrail/Config and strengthen logging (WAF/CloudFront logs). Use blue/green or canary deployments with rollback. 2.2 TECHNICAL PLAN Key activities include:\nInfrastructure provisioning using IaC templates to deploy: Amazon EC2 clusters for application workloads Amazon RDS for database services Amazon S3 for static content and data lake storage Amazon Route 53 for DNS routing Amazon CloudFront and AWS WAF for secure global content delivery Amazon Kinesis for real-time data ingestion Amazon SQS/SNS for asynchronous messaging Amazon EventBridge for event-driven workflows Amazon CloudWatch for logging, monitoring, alarms, and dashboards Amazon QuickSight for analytics and BI reporting This POC does not include AWS Lambda; streaming consumers and asynchronous/background processing are implemented on EC2-based services (or containers) and integrated via SNS/SQS/EventBridge where applicable. Application build and release processes will be automated using CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy, enabling blue/green or rolling deployments with automated rollback. Configuration items requiring approvals (production DNS changes, WAF rule modifications, RDS parameter adjustments, security group updates) will follow the Client’s Change Management Process (including CAB approvals and tracked deployment records). Critical paths (ticketing workflows, payment integrations, real-time ingestion, analytics refresh flows) will undergo unit, integration, load, and failover testing. Test scenarios, acceptance criteria, and validation procedures are provided in Appendix X. 2.3 PROJECT PLAN Stakeholder Participation:\nClient stakeholders (Operations, IT, Data, Security teams) are required for: Sprint Reviews (demo and feedback) Sprint Retrospectives (continuous improvement) UAT and sign-off sessions Technical design workshops Team Responsibilities (high-level):\nCloud Architect – AWS solution design, security architecture, scalability \u0026amp; HA patterns DevOps Engineer – CI/CD pipelines, IaC, automated deployments Application Engineer – application refactoring and integration Client IT Lead – access provisioning, governance alignment Client Operations Team – process validation, UAT testing Client Security Officer – compliance and security controls review Data Engineer – Kinesis pipelines, SQS/SNS integration, data modeling Analytics/BI Engineer – QuickSight dashboards and dataset automation Communication Cadence:\nDaily: standups with Project Team Weekly: project status updates to Client stakeholders Bi-weekly: sprint review + sprint planning Monthly: steering committee meeting Ad-hoc: incident response, change approvals, design deep-dives Knowledge Transfer:\nAWS architecture overview CI/CD pipeline management Monitoring and incident response using CloudWatch Data pipeline operations (Kinesis → S3 → QuickSight) Infrastructure lifecycle \u0026amp; IaC updates Security and IAM operations 2.4 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS Access Security\nImplement least-privilege IAM, role-based access control, and best-practice IAM policies. Enable MFA for privileged accounts. Restrict CI/CD access using scoped IAM roles. Apply change approvals for Route 53 DNS, CloudFront updates, and WAF rule modifications. Infrastructure Security\nDeploy Amazon EC2 in private subnets within a Multi-AZ VPC architecture (production target). Use AWS WAF to protect CloudFront distributions and application endpoints against common exploits. Enforce traffic boundaries via Security Groups and NACLs. Run Amazon RDS in Multi-AZ with encrypted storage and automated backups. Use EventBridge for security-trigger automation (e.g., config rule violations), where applicable. Data Security\nEncrypt data at rest in S3, RDS, Kinesis, and SQS using AWS KMS CMKs. Protect data in transit using TLS 1.2+ across all services. Configure S3 lifecycle policies and object versioning for retention compliance. Data lake structure follows separation of raw, processed, curated layers. Detection \u0026amp; Monitoring\nEnable AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config for full API auditing and compliance tracking. CloudWatch collects logs, metrics, application traces, alarms, and dashboards. Deliver WAF logs and CloudFront access logs to S3 for security analytics. Incident Management\nDesign incident response playbooks for system failures, security breaches, data exposure, and pipeline errors. Trigger automated alerts using SNS/EventBridge to the Client’s operations team. Implement disaster recovery procedures for critical EC2 and RDS workloads. Ensure backup snapshots comply with Client-defined retention policies. Route operational alarms to the correct on-call teams for faster MTTR. 3. ACTIVITIES AND DELIVERABLES 3.1 ACTIVITIES AND DELIVERABLES Timeline basis: Internship duration 08/09/2025 – 22/11/2025 (~11 weeks)\nProject Phase Timeline Activities Deliverables / Milestones Total man-day Assessment Week 1–2 (08/09–21/09) Requirements workshops (business/technical/security); current-state analysis; identify integration points (payments, ticketing, analytics); environment readiness validation Assessment report; Architecture blueprint v1; Backlog \u0026amp; sprint plan TBD Setup base infrastructure Week 3–4 (22/09–05/10) VPC/subnets/routing/SGs; IAM baseline; S3 data lake foundation; CloudFront + WAF + Route53; RDS setup; CloudWatch Infrastructure provisioned; IaC templates delivered; Networking \u0026amp; security baseline TBD Setup component 1 Week 5–6 (06/10–19/10) EC2 Auto Scaling setup; deploy application backend; configure CI/CD (CodePipeline/CodeBuild/CodeDeploy); observability dashboards Application deployed; CI/CD pipelines operational; Monitoring dashboard TBD Setup component 2 Week 7–8 (20/10–02/11) Kinesis streaming pipelines; SQS/SNS messaging; ETL to S3 data lake; QuickSight dashboards; EventBridge workflows Data pipeline operational; Event-driven architecture; Revenue dashboards (daily/monthly); Unpaid/incomplete payments report (with alert thresholds) TBD Testing \u0026amp; Go-live (POC) Week 9–10 (03/11–16/11) Unit/integration/load testing; go-live readiness review; (POC) DNS cutover; monitoring \u0026amp; rozllback plans UAT sign-off; Go-live checklist; POC launch TBD Handover Week 11 (17/11–22/11) Final documentation; operations training; knowledge transfer sessions; transition to BAU Runbooks \u0026amp; SOPs; Admin training completion; Final acceptance TBD How to calculate man-day (guideline):\nMan-day = number of people × number of working days actually spent on the phase. Example: 5 people work 3 days on “Assessment” → 5 × 3 = 15 man-days. If you track by hours: 1 man-day ≈ 8 working hours (common convention). Example: total 120 hours → 120 / 8 = 15 man-days. 3.2 OUT OF SCOPE Custom application code development or feature enhancements not listed in the Scope of Work. On-premises infrastructure upgrades, network redesign, or hardware procurement. Performance tuning of third-party vendor systems. Mobile app development or UI/UX redesign outside the scope. Machine Learning model development beyond QuickSight \u0026amp; basic SageMaker patterns. Penetration testing or third-party security audits (unless contracted separately). Post go-live 24/7 operations unless contracted separately. Support for legacy networks or non-cloud-compatible components. Migration of data sources not included in the initial assessment. AWS Lambda–based serverless compute (event consumers/functions) is out of scope for this POC. 3.3 PATH TO PRODUCTION The Proof of Concept (POC) environment will demonstrate selected use cases defined in Section 2.2.\nThe POC environment will not contain all production-grade capabilities.\nKey gaps requiring enhancements before production deployment include:\nFull resilience design (multi-AZ, failover, scaling policies). Complete observability coverage (CloudWatch metrics, distributed tracing, WAF logs). Hardened security baselines (advanced IAM controls, WAF tuning, encryption policies). Comprehensive testing (integration, performance, DR simulation). CI/CD hardening and automated rollback. Production-approved DNS, WAF, and network change processes. Enhanced error handling and exception flows for edge cases. 4. EXPECTED AWS COST BREAKDOWN BY SERVICES Costing considerations (high-level):\nEC2 estimated using a mix of On-Demand + Reserved Instances/Savings Plans (production). Multi-AZ RDS with automated backups. CloudFront cost includes WAF usage (rule groups + request filtering). S3 includes storage tiers (Standard, Intelligent-Tiering) and lifecycle policies. Log storage and metrics in CloudWatch. Kinesis ingest \u0026amp; processing units. Data transfer cost between components. QuickSight Reader \u0026amp; Author licenses. Messaging (SQS, SNS, EventBridge) based on estimated throughput. Route 53 DNS queries + health checks. Assumptions (for accurate pricing):\nDaily ingestion volume: X GB/day via Kinesis. EC2 sizing based on projected user load for ticketing and payment workloads. S3 storage baseline calculated for 12 months retention. Moderate WAF rule usage and CloudFront regional edge charges. SQS/SNS/EventBridge traffic estimated from projected workflow processes. QuickSight usage includes 1 Author and X Readers. 5.

	"content": "Summary Report: AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2 – DevOps on AWS Event Objectives Understand the core principles of DevOps culture and key performance metrics (DORA). Master the AWS DevOps ecosystem for building end-to-end CI/CD pipelines. Compare and select appropriate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (CloudFormation vs. AWS CDK). Explore containerization strategies using Amazon ECS, EKS, and App Runner. Implement full-stack observability using CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray. Time \u0026amp; Venue Time: 08:30 – 17:00, Monday, November 17, 2025\nVenue: 26th Floor, Bitexco Financial Tower, 2 Hai Trieu Street, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City\nSpeakers Truong Quang Tinh - DevOps Engineer, TymeX | AWS Community Builder Kha Van - Cloud Security Engineer | AWS Community Builders Bao Huynh – AWS Community Builder Thinh Nguyen – AWS Community Builder Vi Tran – AWS Community Builder Key Highlights 1. DevOps Culture \u0026amp; Metrics Cultural Shift: Moving from siloed development and operations to a unified culture of shared responsibility. Key Metrics (DORA): Focusing on four critical indicators to measure performance: Deployment Frequency (DF) Lead Time for Changes (LT) Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) Change Failure Rate (CFR) 2. AWS DevOps Services – CI/CD Pipeline Source Control: Strategies for Git management (GitFlow vs. Trunk-based development) using AWS CodeCommit. Orchestration: Automating the release process with AWS CodePipeline. Deployment Strategies: Blue/Green: Reduces downtime and risk by running two identical environments. Canary: Rolls out changes to a small subset of users first. Rolling: Updates instances incrementally. 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) AWS CloudFormation: The declarative approach using JSON/YAML templates to define infrastructure; utilizes drift detection to maintain state consistency. AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit): The imperative approach allowing developers to define cloud resources using familiar programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Java). CDK constructs allow for reusable infrastructure patterns. 4. Container Services \u0026amp; Observability Compute Evolution: Selection criteria between Amazon ECS (tight control), Amazon EKS (Kubernetes standard), and AWS App Runner (simplified for developers). Observability: Going beyond simple monitoring by integrating CloudWatch (Logs, Metrics, Alarms) with AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing, enabling root-cause analysis in microservices. Key Takeaways Design Mindset Automation First: Manual processes are error-prone; everything from testing to infrastructure provisioning should be automated. Shift-Left Security: Integrating security checks early in the CI/CD pipeline rather than at the end. Measure Everything: You cannot improve what you do not measure. DORA metrics are the compass for DevOps maturity. Technical Architecture Immutable Infrastructure: Servers are never modified after deployment; they are replaced. Pipeline Orchestration: A robust pipeline must include build, unit test, integration test, and approval gates before production deployment. Traceability: In distributed systems, correlating logs and traces (via X-Ray) is mandatory for debugging. Modernization Strategy Right-sizing Compute: Use App Runner for simple web apps to reduce operational overhead, and reserve EKS for complex, orchestrated microservices. IaC Adoption: Moving away from manual console clicks to code-defined infrastructure to ensure reproducibility and disaster recovery. Applying to Work Adopt Trunk-based Development: Streamline the git workflow in the team project to reduce merge conflicts and accelerate integration. Implement CI/CD: Build a pipeline using AWS CodePipeline that automatically deploys the student management backend upon pushing to the main branch. Migrate to IaC: Refactor the current manual setup of DynamoDB and Lambda functions into AWS CDK scripts for better maintainability. Enhance Monitoring: Set up CloudWatch Alarms for critical API errors (5xx) to proactively detect issues before the demo. Event Experience Attending the “DevOps on AWS” workshop was instrumental in bridging the gap between coding and operations. It provided a roadmap for building reliable, scalable systems. Key experiences included:\nLearning from practitioners: The speakers, being active AWS Community Builders, shared \u0026ldquo;war stories\u0026rdquo; and real-world pitfalls in DevOps, not just textbook theory. I gained clarity on the Shared Responsibility Model within a DevOps context. Hands-on technical exposure: Participated in a live CI/CD walkthrough, witnessing raw code transform into a deployed application via an automated pipeline in minutes. Experienced the power of AWS CDK by deploying a VPC and ECS cluster with significantly fewer lines of code compared to raw CloudFormation templates. Visualized distributed tracing with AWS X-Ray, understanding how to pinpoint latency bottlenecks in microservices. Networking and discussions: Engaged in discussions about the trade-offs between GitFlow and Trunk-based development for small teams and received guidance on the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional certification roadmap. Lessons learned IaC is non-negotiable: For any long-term project, infrastructure must be code. Observability is crucial: Building a system is half the battle; knowing it is healthy is the other half. Culture over tools: Tools like Jenkins or CodePipeline are useless without a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. Some event photos Overall, the event not only provided technical skills in AWS tools but also instilled a professional DevOps mindset, preparing me to build production-grade systems efficiently.\n"

Master the core principles: Least Privilege, Zero Trust, and Defense in Depth. Learn how to implement security controls across 5 key areas: IAM, Detection, Infrastructure Protection, Data Protection, and Incident Response. Identify top security threats in the cloud environment specifically for the Vietnamese market. Time \u0026amp; Venue Time: 08:30 – 12:00, Saturday, November 29, 2025\nVenue: 26th Floor, Bitexco Financial Tower, 2 Hai Trieu Street, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City\nSpeakers Le Vu Xuan An - Software \u0026amp; Cloud Engineer | AWS Cloud Club Captain HCMUTE Tran Doan Cong Ly - DevOps Engineer | AWS FCAJ Ambassador | AWS Cloud Club Captain PTIT Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi – AI Engineer, Renova Cloud | AWS First Cloud AI Journey | AWS Cloud Club Captain HUFLIT Tran Duc Anh - Cloud Security Engineer Trainee | First Cloud AI Journey | AWS Cloud Club Captain SGU Nguyen Tuan Thinh - Cloud Engineer Trainee | First Cloud AI Journey Nguyen Do Thanh Dat - Cloud Engineer Trainee | First Cloud AI Journey Đinh Le Hoang Anh – Cloud Engineer Trainee | First Cloud AI Journey Kha Van - Cloud Security Engineer | AWS Community Builders Special Guest:\nMendel Grabski - Cloud Security \u0026amp; Solution Architect | Enabling Secure-by-Design Solutions Truong Quang Tinh - DevOps Engineer, TymeX | AWS Community Builder Key Highlights 1. Security Foundations \u0026amp; Identity (IAM) Core Principles: Moved beyond perimeter security to a Zero Trust model where every request must be authenticated and authorized. Modern IAM: Transition from long-term credentials (IAM Users with Access Keys) to temporary credentials via IAM Roles and Identity Center (SSO). Enforcing Least Privilege using Access Analyzer to validate policies. Multi-Account Strategy: Using SCPs (Service Control Policies) to set permission boundaries across the organization. 2. Detection \u0026amp; Continuous Monitoring Centralized Visibility: utilizing Security Hub to aggregate alerts from GuardDuty, Inspector, and Macie. Logging Strategy: Enabling logs at all layers is non-negotiable (VPC Flow Logs for network, CloudTrail for API calls, S3 Server Access Logs). Detection-as-Code: Defining alert rules as code to ensure consistent monitoring across environments. 3. Infrastructure \u0026amp; Data Protection Network Security: Implementing Defense in Depth with VPC segmentation (Public/Private subnets), Security Groups (stateful), and WAF/Shield for edge protection. Encryption: At-rest: Using KMS with automatic key rotation for EBS, RDS, and S3. In-transit: Enforcing TLS 1.2+ for all data movement. Secrets Management: replacing hardcoded credentials in code with AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store. 4. Incident Response (IR) Automation IR Lifecycle: Preparation → Detection \u0026amp; Analysis → Containment, Eradication \u0026amp; Recovery → Post-Incident Activity. Playbooks: Detailed walkthroughs for handling common scenarios like compromised IAM keys or public S3 buckets. Automation: Using Lambda and Step Functions to auto-remediate issues (e.g., automatically revoking a compromised user\u0026rsquo;s session). Key Takeaways Security Mindset Security is everyone\u0026rsquo;s responsibility: It is not just for the security team; developers must practice \u0026ldquo;Security by Design\u0026rdquo;. Assume Breach: Always design systems assuming that a component might be compromised, limiting the \u0026ldquo;blast radius\u0026rdquo;. Technical Architecture Identity as the new perimeter: In a cloud-native world, IAM is more critical than the network firewall. Immutable Infrastructure: Patching servers in place is risky; prefer replacing them with new, patched images to prevent malware persistence. Applying to Work Refactor IAM: Immediately review the group project\u0026rsquo;s IAM policies. Remove any *:* permissions and replace hardcoded Access Keys with IAM Roles for EC2/Lambda. Secure Secrets: Migrate database credentials from .env files to AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Enable GuardDuty: Activate GuardDuty in the project account to detect anomalies (cryptojacking, unauthorized access) during the development phase. Encryption: Enable default encryption (SSE-S3) for all S3 buckets used in the Student Management System project. Event Experience The workshop provided a concentrated, high-intensity dive into cloud security. Unlike general overviews, this session focused on actionable patterns:\nInteractive Learning: The mini-demo on validating IAM Policies and simulating access helped visualize how easily permissions can be misconfigured. Real-world relevance: Discussing \u0026ldquo;Top threats in Vietnam\u0026rdquo; made the content highly relatable, emphasizing the need to protect against common misconfigurations and credential leaks. Practical Automation: Seeing an automated IR playbook triggered by EventBridge and executed by Lambda changed my perspective on how to handle security incidents at scale. Some Event Photos This event shifted my perspective from \u0026ldquo;building it fast\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;building it secure.\u0026rdquo; I now have a clear roadmap to harden our applications before they reach production.\n"

Also i have to optimize the cost, performance and increased security layers\nWhen i am in the company, i always to check my to do list and check all the task that i haven\u0026rsquo;t done yesterday. Besides that i have chance to meet my mentor and ask them help when i have an issue or something. In the progress of study, me with my teammates have to build the websites and using AWS services.\nTo objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:\nNo. Criteria Description Good Fair Average 1 Professional knowledge \u0026amp; skills Understanding of the field, applying knowledge in practice, proficiency with tools, work quality ☐ ✅ ☐ 2 Ability to learn Ability to absorb new knowledge and learn quickly ☐ ✅ ☐ 3 Proactiveness Taking initiative, seeking out tasks without waiting for instructions ✅ ☐ ☐ 4 Sense of responsibility Completing tasks on time and ensuring quality ☐ ✅ ☐ 5 Discipline Adhering to schedules, rules, and work processes ✅ ☐ ☐ 6 Progressive mindset Willingness to receive feedback and improve oneself ☐ ☐ ✅ 7 Communication Presenting ideas and reporting work clearly ☐ ✅ ☐ 8 Teamwork Working effectively with colleagues and participating in teams ☐ ✅ ☐ 9 Professional conduct Respecting colleagues, partners, and the work environment ✅ ☐ ☐ 10 Problem-solving skills Identifying problems, proposing solutions, and showing creativity ☐ ✅ ☐ 11 Contribution to project/team Work effectiveness, innovative ideas, recognition from the team ✅ ☐ ☐ 12 Overall General evaluation of the entire internship period ☐ ✅ ☐ Needs Improvement I am internal person so i barely communicated with my mentor, i need to change my how to communicate with my mentor and spend time to meet them to ask them about my problem. I need improve my project management skill because i have to train my teammates and give them a task but i don\u0026rsquo;t have a method like Agile or Scrum to develop a software like coworker. I always to think about how the services work and how they apply to my application but sometime i don\u0026rsquo;t understand them, so i need to spend time to improve my logic mindset to understand them.

	"content": " Here you can freely provide personal feedback about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program, helping the FCJ team improve areas that need attention based on the following categories:\nGeneral Evaluation 1. Work Environment\nThe work environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to support me whenever I face difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think additional team bonding or networking sessions could help everyone understand each other more.\n2. Support from Mentors / Team Admins\nMentors provide detailed guidance, explain clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourage me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, documents, and creates conditions for smooth work. I appreciate that mentors allow me to try and solve problems on my own instead of just giving answers.\n3. Job Fit with Academic Background\nThe tasks assigned match my knowledge from school while also expanding into new areas I had not encountered before. This allowed me to reinforce my foundational knowledge while learning practical skills.\n4. Learning Opportunities \u0026amp; Skill Development\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork, and professional communication in a corporate environment. Mentors also shared practical experiences, helping me better plan my career path.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: people respect each other, work seriously but remain cheerful. When urgent projects arise, everyone helps each other regardless of position. This made me feel part of the team even as an intern.\n6. Intern Benefits / Policies\nThe company provides internship allowances and offers flexible working hours when needed. Additionally, participating in internal training sessions is a great advantage.\nOther Questions What are you most satisfied with during the internship?\nDuring the learning process, I felt comfortable adapting to the company’s work culture and was very satisfied with the guidance from mentors. What do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?\nThe company could improve opportunities for students to come to the office daily. If recommending to friends, would you advise them to intern here? Why?\nIf I were to introduce this to friends, I would recommend it because Amazon Web Services Vietnam is not only a cloud computing company but also has a large AWS study group community in Vietnam, allowing students to learn about cloud computing. Suggestions \u0026amp; Wishes Any advice to enhance the internship experience?\nI would like to join the company club to learn more from mentors and see how they lead a team. Would you like to continue this program in the future?\nI would like to be more closely associated with the company. Other feedback (free sharing)\nNo additional feedback at this time. "
